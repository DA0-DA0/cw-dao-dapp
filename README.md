## DAO DAO UI

This project creates a web UI for the [DAO DAO smart
contracts](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts), enabling users to:

- create a governance token-based DAO, membership-based DAO (multisig), or other
  type of DAO.
- create and vote on proposals.
- view the treasury and manage it democratically.

All without having to code!

You can find more info in our [documentation](https://docs.daodao.zone). Join
the [DAO DAO Discord](https://discord.daodao.zone) if you're interested in
becoming a contributor.

## Development

### Clone this repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-dao-ui
cd dao-dao-ui
yarn
```

### Setup environment variables

To run the server on mainnet, copy `.env.mainnet` to `.env.local` in the app
folder you care about (likely `apps/dapp`).

Copy `.env.testnet` instead if you want to run testnet.

### Run dev server

If you're here to work on any other part of the app, likely accessing live chain
data, run the `yarn dev` script (equivalent to running `yarn dev` from the
[`./apps/dapp`](./apps/dapp) package) to run the main app in development mode.

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Storybook

If you're here to work on UI components in isolation, you will likely want to
run the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) server to mock up components and
iterate quickly without having to access live chain data. Check out the
[storybook package README](./packages/storybook) for usage
instructions.

To start the Storybook server, run this command from the root of this monorepo:

```bash
yarn storybook start
```

If something is misconfigured, check out the docs for
[Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/docs), the monorepo build system we use.

### Building Docker Images

To create a dockerized image, simply run the following commands:

#### For DAPP
```sh
docker-compose build dapp --build-arg BUILDPLATFORM=linux/arm64 --build-arg TARGETPLATFORM=linux/amd64
```

#### For SDA
```sh
docker-compose build sda --build-arg BUILDPLATFORM=linux/arm64 --build-arg TARGETPLATFORM=linux/amd64
```

**Note:** Set the `DAPP_IMAGE` and `SDA_IMAGE` environment variables to your desired image names, e.g.:
```bash
DAPP_IMAGE=da0-da0/dao-app-dapp:v0.0.2
SDA_IMAGE=da0-da0/dao-app-sda:v0.0.2
```

These commands will build the images for the specified platforms. Just replace `linux/arm64` and `linux/amd64` with your machine's platform and the intended platform for the image, respectively.

***Important:** Please note that building images for cross-platform architectures can take a significant amount of time, as the build process needs to compile and package the image for the target platform. Be patient and let the build process complete. You can grab a cup of coffee or take a short break while you wait!*
