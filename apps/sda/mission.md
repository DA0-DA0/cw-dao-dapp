## Raw DAO&apos;s mission statement

### A Vision of Coordination

The Coordination Game is a game-theory optimized Keeper protocol that
provides a solution to the MEV incentive structure problem on Ethereum. By
aligning Keeper's incentives with those of the other network
participants, it gives them a new game to play, in which they can fully
fulfill their potential as beneficial actors inside the Ethereum
ecosystem.

And for them to fulfill their roles more effectively - without the
aforementioned negative externalities - there needs to be a transparent,
efficient and decentralized market for their services. That doesn't
exist right now. It's not clear how many Keepers there are, how much
liquidity they command, how protocols should optimally price risk, or how
users and protocols should bid for Keeper attention when they require
services.
