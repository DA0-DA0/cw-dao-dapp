      <h2>A Vision of Coordination</h2>
      <p>
        The Coordination Game is a game-theory optimised Keeper protocol that
        provides a solution to the MEV incentive structure problem on Ethereum.
        By aligning Keeper&apos;s incentives with those of the other network
        participants, it gives them a new game to play, in which they can fully
        fulfill their potential as beneficial actors inside the Ethereum
        ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        And for them to fulfill their roles more effectively - without the
        aforementioned negative externalities - there needs to be a transparent,
        efficient and decentralised market for their services. That doesn&apos;t
        exist right now. It&apos;s not clear how many Keepers there are, how
        much liquidity they command, how protocols should optimally price risk,
        or how users and protocols should bid for Keeper attention when they
        require services.
