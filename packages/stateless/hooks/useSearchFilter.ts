// Pass an array of data and filterable keys, and get `searchBarProps` (for
// passing to `SearchBar`) and memoized `filteredData`.
//
// NOTE: `data` is often un-memoized, so it is very important not to update any
// state when `data` changes. Doing so could lead to an infinite loop, in the
// event that the state update causes `data` to change again, which is not
// uncommon. This is due to the variety of input data sources. Ideally, all data
// comes from a state selector that is memoized, but often data must be updated
// on-the-fly based on various display conditions; memoizing all the inputs to
// this hook would require a bunch of extra `useMemo` hooks that would probably
// reduce performance beyond what would be worth it, and it would require all
// contributors to have an in-depth understanding of the nuances of React hooks,
// references, Fuse.js, etc. The solution here is to simply update the Fuse.js
// collection before filtering, which should be a relatively cheap (linear time)
// operation because most lists being filtered are short. We are not filtering
// thousands of items from an arbitrary databaseâ€”typically we are just filtering
// a handful of actions or NFTs. Previously, this hook was trying to be clever
// and only update the Fuse.js collection when the data deeply changed, but that
// required extra state updates and logic that often led to infinite loops. If
// this becomes a performance issue, we can revisit this.
